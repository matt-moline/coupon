# The impact of various customer characteristics on the acceptance of a coupon for services #
The goal of this project is to evaluate a set of data gathered for a pilot program where coupons for discounted services for a few types of establishments (Bars, Restaurants, etc) were offered to potential customers.
Data was logged on each potential customer and the outcome of the offer (acceptance or rejection) was recorded.
